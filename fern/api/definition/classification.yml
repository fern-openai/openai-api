      docs: >
        Classifies the specified `query` using provided examples.
        The endpoint first [searches](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) over the
        labeled examples
        to select the ones most relevant for the particular query. Then, the
        relevant examples
        are combined with the query to construct a prompt to produce the final
        label via the
        [completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.
        Labeled examples can be provided via an uploaded `file`, or explicitly
        listed in the
        request using the `examples` parameter for quick tests and small scale
        use cases.

    properties:
      model:
        docs: >-
          ID of the model to use. You can use the [List
          models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your
          available models, or see our [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview)
          for descriptions of them.
        type: string
      query:
        docs: Query to be classified.
        type: string
      examples:
        docs: >
          A list of examples with labels, in the following format:
          `[["The movie is so interesting.", "Positive"], ["It is quite
          boring.", "Negative"], ...]`
          All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.
          You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.
        type: optional<list<list<string>>>
      file:
        docs: >
          The ID of the uploaded file that contains training examples. See
          [upload file](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a
          file of the desired format and purpose.
          You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.
        type: optional<string>
      labels:
        docs: >-
          The set of categories being classified. If not specified, candidate
          labels will be automatically collected from the examples you provide.
          All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.
        type: optional<list<string>>
      search_model:
        docs: >-
          ID of the model to use for
          [Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches/create). You can select one of
          `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, or `davinci`.
        type: optional<string>
      temperature:
        docs: |
          What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. 
          Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
        type: optional<double>
      logprobs:
        docs: >
          Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as
          well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will
          return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return
          the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1`
          elements in the response.
          The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. If you need more than this,
          please contact us through our [Help center](https://help.openai.com)
          and describe your use case.
          When `logprobs` is set, `completion` will be automatically added into
          `expand` to get the logprobs.
        type: optional<integer>
      max_examples:
        docs: >-
          The maximum number of examples to be ranked by
          [Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches/create) when using `file`.
          Setting it to a higher value leads to improved accuracy but with
          increased latency and cost.
        type: optional<integer>
      logit_bias:
        docs: >
          Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
          Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
          the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
          can use this [tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for
          both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
          the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to
          sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1
          and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like
          -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the
          relevant token.
          As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the
          <|endoftext|> token from being generated.
        type: optional<map<string, integer>>
      return_prompt:
        docs: >-
          If set to `true`, the returned JSON will include a "prompt" field
          containing the final prompt that was used to request a completion.
          This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.
        type: optional<boolean>
      return_metadata:
        docs: >
          A special boolean flag for showing metadata. If set to `true`, each
          document entry in the returned JSON will contain a "metadata" field.
          This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.
        type: optional<boolean>
      expand:
        docs: >-
          If an object name is in the list, we provide the full information of
          the object; otherwise, we only provide the object ID. Currently we
          support `completion` and `file` objects for expansion.
        type: optional<list<unknown>>
      user:
