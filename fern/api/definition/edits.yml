        docs: >-
          ID of the model to use. You can use the [List
          models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your
          available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview)
          for descriptions of them.
        type: string
      input:
        docs: The input text to use as a starting point for the edit.
        type: optional<string>
      instruction:
        docs: The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt.
        type: string
      n:
        docs: How many edits to generate for the input and instruction.
        type: optional<integer>
      temperature:
        docs: >
          What [sampling
          temperature](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277)
          to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9
          for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with
          a well-defined answer.
          We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
        type: optional<double>
      top_p:
        docs: >
          An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,
          where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p
          probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10%
          probability mass are considered.
          We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
